A Rust implementation of [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) for producing and consuming asyncronous tasks with a distributed message queue.

We welcome contributions from everyone regardless of your experience level with Rust. For complete beginners, see [HACKING_QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/blob/master/HACKING_QUICKSTART.md).

If you already know the basics of Rust, the [Rusty Celery Book](https://rusty-celery.github.io/) is the best place to start. It contains numerous examples and guides to best practices. If you're coming from Python you may also be interested to know [what's different](https://rusty-celery.github.io/coming-from-python/index.html). And if you've never heard of Celery, the official [Celery Project](http://www.celeryproject.org/) is a great source of tutorials and overviews.

## Quick start

The `./examples` directory contains a simple Celery app that is implemented in both Rust ([celery_app.rs](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/blob/master/examples/celery_app.rs)) and Python ([celery_app.py](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/blob/master/examples/celery_app.py)) using an AMQP broker. 

If you already have an AMQP broker running you can set the environment variable `AMQP_URL` to your broker's URL. Otherwise simply run the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/brokers/amqp.sh
```

This will download and run the official [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) image (RabbitMQ is a popular AMQP broker). Then from a separate terminal run the script:

```bash
./examples/python_to_rust.sh
```

This sends a series of tasks from the Python app to the Rust app. You can also send tasks from Rust to Python by running:

```bash
./examples/rust_to_python.sh
```

## Road map and current state

🟢 = Supported and mostly stable, although there may be a few incomplete features.<br/>
🟠 = Partially implemented and under active development.<br/>
🔴 = Not supported yet but on-deck to be implemented soon.
