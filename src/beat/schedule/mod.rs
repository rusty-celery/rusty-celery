//! This module contains the definition of application-provided schedules.
//!
//! These structs have not changed a lot compared to Python: in Python there are three
//! different types of schedules: `schedule` (corresponding to [`RegularSchedule`]),
//! `crontab` (corresponding to [`CronSchedule`]), `solar` (not implemented yet).
