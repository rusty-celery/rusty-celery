## Unreleased

### Changed

- Uses of `std::sync::Mutex` and `std::sync::RwLock` changed to their async-aware equivalents from `tokio`.
- The `Celery::register_task` method is now an async function due to the above.

### Removed

- The `SyncError` variants have been removed.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2019-02-19

### Changed

- `Celery::consume_from` now only accepts a single queue (once again) since there was a critical bug when we allowed consuming from multiple queues.

## [0.2.0-alpha.0] - 2019-02-17

### Added

- Several error enums: `CeleryError`, `TaskError`, `BrokerError`, `ProtocolError`.
- `TaskResultExt` for easily converting the error type in a `Result` to a `TaskError` variant.

### Changed

- The `error` module.
- The structure of the public API is now more compact. We expose a few more modules, including `broker`, `task`, and `error` instead of exporting all of the public elements from the crate root.
- The `app` macro (previously `celery_app`) no longer takes an actual broker type (like `AMQPBroker`) for the `broker` parameter. Instead you can just use the literal token `AMQP`. This means one less import for the user.

### Removed

- The `Error` type.
- The `celery_app` macro has been renamed to just `app`.
- The `ResultExt` re-export.
