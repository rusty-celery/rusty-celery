## Unreleased

### Changed

- Now using `tokio-amqp` internally with `lapin`.

### Fixed

- Task ID now logged when a beat app sends a task.

## v0.4.0-rc4 - 2020-09-16

### Added

- Added a `MockBroker` for internal testing.
- Added more tests to the `app` module.
- Added a `prelude` module.
- Added support for YAML, MsgPack, and Pickle content types, behind the `extra_content_types` feature flag.

### Changed

- Improved `TaskResultExt`. Now takes a `FnOnce() -> Context` instead of `&str`.

### Fixed

- Ensure a `Signature` inherits default `TaskOptions` from the corresponding `Task` and `Celery` or `Beat` app.
- Cleaned up remaining uses of `.unwrap()` in the library.
- Options returned with `Task::options()` now have the current values, where app-level values are overriden by task-level values.

## v0.4.0-rc3 - 2020-09-09

### Added

- Added a `.display_pretty()` method on the `Celery` struct that prints out a cool ASCII logo
  with some useful information about the app.
- Added an `AsyncResult` struct that acts as a handler for task results.
- Added `Task::retry_with_countdown` and `Task::retry_with_eta` trait methods so that tasks can
  manually trigger a retry.

### Changed

- Fields of the `Signature` struct made private to avoid confusion around which fields of `TaskOptions` apply to a `Signature`.
- `Celery::send_task` now returns an `AsyncResult` instead of a `String` for the `Ok` variant.
- Renamed `DummyBackend` to `LocalSchedulerBackend`.
- Switched to [`thiserror`](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) for the error module instead of the deprecated `failure` crate.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where `hard_time_limit` was ignored by worker if only specified at the app or task level.

## v0.4.0-rc2 - 2020-08-27

### Added

- Added a `reconnect` method on the `Broker`.

### Changed

- `Celery` and `Beat` apps will automatically try to reconnect the broker when the connection fails.

## v0.4.0-rc1 - 2020-08-18

### Added

- Added a `hard_time_limit` task option for compatability with Python.

### Changed

- The `timeout` task option was renamed to `time_limit` to be more consistent with the Python API.

### Fixed

- Compiles on Windows

## v0.3.1 - 2020-07-22

### Added

- `beat` module with basic support for scheduling tasks.
- `beat` macro to create a `Beat` app.

## v0.3.0 - 2020-05-28

### Changed

- `lapin` dependency updated to 1.0.
- `BrokerError` variants trimmed and simplified.
- The error handler closure passed to `Broker::consume` now takes a `BrokerError` as an argument.
- Improved error messages.

## v0.2.6 - 2020-05-14

### Fixed

- `Message::headers::origin` field fixed. Before it included quotes around the hostname.

### Added

- `Request::hostname` field now populated by the `Celery` app consuming the task.

### Changed

- Sending a task `with_timeout` will only set the `soft_time_limit` so that the behavior
is the same for Python consumers.

## v0.2.5 - 2020-03-24

### Changed

- Tasks must explicity return a `TaskResult<T>` now.

## v0.2.4 - 2020-03-16

## Added

- A `retry_for_unexpected` task configuration option. By default this is `true` (so the default behavior is unchanged).
But if set to `false`, tasks that raised `TaskError::UnexpectedError` won't be retried.

## v0.2.3 - 2020-03-10

### Changed

- `CeleryBuilder::task_route` now infallible. Error could be raised during the `build` phase instead.
- `Celery::consume_from` will return `Err(CeleryError::NoQueueToConsume)` if the slice of queues is empty.

## v0.2.2 - 2020-03-06

### Changed

- `Celery::consume_from` now takes multiple queues instead of just a single queue.
- Retry ETA method moved from tracer to task so that it can be customized.
- `TaskError` variants restricted to only `ExpectedError`, `UnexpectedError`, and `TimeoutError`. The `Retry` and `ExpirationError` variants moved to a new (non-public) error type: `TracerError`.

## v0.2.1 - 2020-03-05

### Added

- `on_failure` and `on_success` options to `task` attribute macro.

### Changed

- Removed `task_id` and `params` arguments to `on_failure` and `on_success` callbacks, since those can be gotten from the request object.

## v0.2.0 - 2020-03-02

### Added

- A `Signature` struct with includes task execution options (previously the fields in `TaskSendOptions`).
- A `bind` argument to the `task` macro. When `bind = true` is given, the task will be run as an instance method.
- A `Request` struct.

### Changed

- `protocol::TryIntoMessage` trait renamed to `TryCreateMessage` and the one trait function `try_into_message` renamed to `try_create_message` to better reflect the fact that the trait function does not consume `self`.
- Task parameters are now separated from task struct.
- Task callback methods `on_failure` and `on_success` are now instance methods.
- `Celery::send_task` now takes a `Signature` instead of a `Task`.
- When tasks are defined through the `task` macro by annoting a function, that function needs to be explicity marked async for the function to use async / await syntax.

### Removed

- `TaskContext` struct.
- `TaskSendOptions`.
- `Celery::send_task_with`.

## v0.2.0-alpha.2 - 2020-02-24

### Changed

- Uses of `std::sync::Mutex` and `std::sync::RwLock` changed to their async-aware equivalents from `tokio`.
- The `Celery::register_task` method is now an async function due to the above.
- Fixed bug where tasks with a future ETA were acked before they were due, resulting in such tasks being lost if the worker was shutdown before they were due.

### Removed

- The `SyncError` variants have been removed.

## v0.2.0-alpha.1 - 2020-02-19

### Changed

- `Celery::consume_from` now only accepts a single queue (once again) since there was a critical bug when we allowed consuming from multiple queues.

## v0.2.0-alpha.0 - 2020-02-17

### Added

- Several error enums: `CeleryError`, `TaskError`, `BrokerError`, `ProtocolError`.
- `TaskResultExt` for easily converting the error type in a `Result` to a `TaskError` variant.

### Changed

- The `error` module.
- The structure of the public API is now more compact. We expose a few more modules, including `broker`, `task`, and `error` instead of exporting all of the public elements from the crate root.
- The `app` macro (previously `celery_app`) no longer takes an actual broker type (like `AMQPBroker`) for the `broker` parameter. Instead you can just use the literal token `AMQP`. This means one less import for the user.

### Removed

- The `Error` type.
- The `celery_app` macro has been renamed to just `app`.
- The `ResultExt` re-export.
